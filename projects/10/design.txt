Overall
=======

The main program is read from stdin.
The program is then passed to init_lex which initializes the lexeThe lexer is then passed to the scanner which is the main part of the compiler.

Scanner
--------
Takes a statemachine and a lexer as arguments.

It then obtains lexemes from the lexer and then moves through the state machine using the lexeme as the transition.

As it is doing that, it accumulates lexemes into a token list, which it then returns at the end.

The state machine traversal automatically catches errors when invalid transitions are encountered.

To handle Lident, we need to defined a function that splits a Lexeme into the Lexeme type and the Lexeme value (e.g., Lident("foo") would be split into Lident and "foo", while Lend would be split into Lend and None)

How to handle multiple state machines?
--------------------------------------
Use a tuple (sm#, state#) where the first number defines the active state machine and the second number defines the active state.
